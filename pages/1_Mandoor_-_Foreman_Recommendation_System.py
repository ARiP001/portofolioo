    Finding the right construction foreman in Indonesia is often a gamble. The process is scattered, inefficient, and heavily reliant on subjective, word-of-mouth recommendations. Home and business owners often struggle to accurately compare skills, availability, and costs, which can lead to delayed projects or unsatisfactory results.

    **This is where Mandoor comes in as the solution.** Mandoor is an intelligent application designed to revolutionize this process. By harnessing the power of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, Mandoor transforms a complex search into a fast, data-driven, and trustworthy experience.

    My role was **Machine Learning Engineer**. I did more than just write code; I was responsible for designing and building the **brain** behind the application.

        - **Tokenization:** Converting narrative user project descriptions into a format the model could understand.

The result is a **'relevance score'**‚Äîa number that intelligently measures how well-suited a foreman is for a job. This score is what the application uses to present a ranked list of top recommendations to the user.

    3.  **Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration:** Working closely with the Cloud and Mobile teams taught me the importance of effective communication to create a well-integrated product.
