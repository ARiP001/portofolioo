    Finding the right construction foreman in Indonesia is often a gamble. The process is scattered, inefficient, and heavily reliant on subjective, word-of-mouth recommendations. Home and business owners often struggle to accurately compare skills, availability, and costs, which can lead to delayed projects or unsatisfactory results.

    **This is where Mandoor comes in as the solution.** Mandoor is an intelligent application designed to revolutionize this process. By harnessing the power of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, Mandoor transforms a complex search into a fast, data-driven, and trustworthy experience.

    My role was **Machine Learning Engineer**. I did more than just write code; I was responsible for designing and building the **brain** behind the application. My tasks covered the entire machine learning workflow, from data collection to creating a functional model that forms the core of the Mandoor user experience.

        - **Tokenization:** Converting narrative user project descriptions into a format the model could understand.

        This model is designed to 'understand' the nuances of user project descriptions (textual data) and match them with the most suitable foreman profiles (numerical data). The result is a **'relevance score'**—a number that intelligently measures how well-suited a foreman is for a job. This score is what the application uses to present a ranked list of top recommendations to the user.
