st.markdown("""
This project originated from a **real-world problem**, identified after **interviewing a local minimarket owner** to understand their daily operational challenges. The resulting solution was this desktop Point of Sale (POS) application, built with **Java** and grounded in strong **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. As the **Java Developer** in a two-person **GROUP PROJECT**, my core responsibilities involved both backend logic and **implementing the code from the Figma design.**

st.header("Impact & Learning")
st.markdown("""
I architected the application's **OOP structure** by designing a robust class hierarchy for entities like `Products` and `Transactions`, using principles of **encapsulation** and **inheritance**. I then translated the high-fidelity UI/UX designs from **Figma** into a functional GUI using **Java Swing/JavaFX**, implementing key features such as sales processing and the ability to **download reports in PDF format**.

This project was a valuable experience, teaching me how to translate **direct user feedback** from an interview into concrete technical requirements. It solidified my ability to apply **OOP** theory to solve a practical business need and to translate a visual design from **Figma** into a functional product. Collaborating in a team environment further honed my skills in dividing technical responsibilities to achieve a common goal, reinforcing my drive to build complete, user-centric solutions at the **Academy**.
