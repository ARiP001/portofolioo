st.markdown("""
In this **individual project**, I performed a complete analysis and visualization of the Capital Bikeshare dataset to uncover key usage patterns. My work encompassed the full data pipeline, from preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) in a Jupyter Notebook to the deployment of an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**. Through this dashboard, users can explore rental patterns and identify relationships between factors like weather and user type.

st.header("Impact & Learning")
st.markdown("""
This project demonstrates strong skills in data science, including **data wrangling**, analytical thinking, and effective data visualization with **Pandals**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. By developing and deploying an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**, I learned to present complex data insights in an accessible, user-friendly format, turning a static analysis into a dynamic data product. This experience of transforming raw data into an interactive, user-facing product is exactly what I am passionate about, and it's why I am eager to build upon these skills in the collaborative, product-focused environment of the **Academy**.
